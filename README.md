# Overview

Shared utilities / handed-off scripts for the AI for Earth team

The general convention in this repo is that users who want to consume these utilities will add the top-level path of the repo to their Python path, so it's OK to assume that other packages/modules within the repo are available.  The "scrap" directory can be used for standalone, one-time-use scripts that you might otherwise have emailed to someone.
